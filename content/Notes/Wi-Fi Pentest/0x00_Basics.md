In Detail:
- `WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy)`: The original WiFi security protocol, it provides basic encryption, it is now considered outdated and vulnerable.
- `WPA (WiFi Protected Access)`: Introduced as an improvement over WEP, WPA offers better encryption with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), but is still less secure than newer standards.
- `WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access II)`: A significant advancement over WPA, WPA2 uses AES( Advanced Encryption Standard) for robust security. It has been the standard for many years.
- `WPA3 (WiFi Protected Access III)`: The latest standard, WPA3, enhances security with features like individualized data encryption and more robust password-based authentication, it is the most secure option currently available.
