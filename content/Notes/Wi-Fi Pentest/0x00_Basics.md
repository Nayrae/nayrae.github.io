In this times, WiFi networks serve as the backbone of our digital connectivity.
This convenience comes with the risks of vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
WiFi pentesting is crucial and it is done by :
- Assessing passphrases for strength and security
- Analyzing configuration settings to identify vulnerabilities
- Probing the network infrastructure for weaknesses
- Testing client devices for potential security flaws

# Wi-Fi Authentication Types

Knowing the different WiFi authentication types is crucial for the job.
The main types include:
- WEP
- WPA
- WPA2
- WPA3
each progressively enhancing security standards.

- `WEP (Wireless Equivalent Privacy)`: The original WiFi security protocol, it provides basic encryption, it is now considered outdated and vulnerable.
- `WPA (WiFi Protected Access)`: Introduced as an improvement over WEP, WPA offers better encryption with TKIP (Temporal Key Integrity Protocol), but is still less secure than newer standards.
- `WPA2 (WiFi Protected Access II)`: A significant advancement over WPA, WPA2 uses AES( Advanced Encryption Standard) for robust security. It has been the standard for many years.
- `WPA3 (WiFi Protected Access III)`: The latest standard, WPA3, enhances security with features like individualized data encryption and more robust password-based authentication, it is the most secure option currently available.


# 4 Components of WiFi Pentest in Detail

1. `Evaluating Passphrases`: Assessing the strength and security of WiFi network passwords or passphrases. Techniques such as dictionary attacks, brute force attacks, and password cracking tools are employed to evaluate the resilience of passphrases.
2. `Evaluating Configuration`: Analyzing the configuration setting of WiFi routers and access points to identify potential security vulnerabilities. 
3. `Testing the Infrastructure`:
