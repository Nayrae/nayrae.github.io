## Key Generation

1. 2 prime numbers are chosen: $p, q$
2. we calculate $n = pq$
3.  $φ(n)? =  (p-1)(q-1)(totient)$ is calculated
4.  $e$ is chosen, and we compress with $e$ smaller than $φ(n)$
5.  $d t.c. ed ≡ 1 mod ϕ(n) (d = e−1 mod ϕ(n))$ is calculated
6. private key is $(n,d)$, public key is $(n,e)$
